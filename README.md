Hi, i'm Anton Nedyak, a systems analyst in [SmartDS](https://smartds.ru "SmartDS site").

My work experience as a systems analyst is related to two companies. 
- In the first company, this involved working on the internal sales system of a large retailer. The system exists as a web application with a C# backend and is integrated with ERP and the online store.
- In the second company, I worked on the functionality for order placement and management of transportation in the system of a major logistics company. This system is a client-server application with a server-side implemented in PL/SQL and a client-side built using Delphi. The tasks I handle are related to the improvement of existing and implementation of new functionality at the request of internal business customers.

I identify and describe requirements, write technical specifications and documentation. I also analyze code errors, when necessary, conduct system research for business customers (describing the system AS IS), consult with developers and testers on technical specifications and the company's business processes.

When identifying requirements, I interview customers, study documentation, examine relationships with future and existing requirements, and review the system code. Sometimes I have to model business processes using BPMN and create simple wireframe interface layouts for customer approval.
